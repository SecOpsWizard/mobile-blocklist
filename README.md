# AdGuardHome DNS Filter List

This list combines several other major lists, including AdGuards default lists.

To add this list to your AdGuardHome, use the following link » https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppfeufer/adguard-filter-list/master/blocklist

Which lists I'm using here, you can see in the shell script that puts this list together » [click here](create-adguard-block.list.sh)

You are free to use this list, but I can give you no guarantee for it, since none of the lists combined here is managed by me.
